It was a 2-door sports car, looked to be from the late 60s/\\nearly 70s. It was called a Bricklin. The doors were really small. In addition,\\nthe front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. This is \\nall I know. If anyone can tellme a model name, engine specs, years\\nof production, where this car is made, history, or whatever info you\\nhave on this funky looking car, please e-mail.\\n\\nThanks,\\n- IL\\n   ---- brought to you by your neighborhood Lerxst ----\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"]"

      "\tcommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower\n",
      "\tclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\n",
      "\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\n",

      "    1)\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\n",

      "    2)\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\n",
      "\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\n",
      "\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\n",

      "    7)\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\n",
      "\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\n",
      "\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\n",

      "    This all begs the question, \"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give\n",
      "    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\n",
      "    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\n",
      "    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\n",

      "    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\n",

      "    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\n",

      "   with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K\n",

      "2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:\n",

      "\n",
      "3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development\n",
      "   Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger\n",

      "* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\n",
      "\n",
      "  The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It\n",
      "  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and\n",
      "  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is\n",
      "  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,\n",
      "  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the\n",
      "  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of\n",
      "  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many\n",
      "  years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break\n",
      "  many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national\n",
      "  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of\n",
      "  the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the\n",
      "  difference between public and private research in cryptography:\n",
      "\n",
      "  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,\n",
      "  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted\n",
      "  behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged\n",
      "  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of\n",
      "  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10\n",
      "  years has there in fact been widespread open research in\n",
      "  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts\n",
      "  between these two research communities. Open research is common\n",
      "  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open\n",
      "  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in\n",
      "  scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with\n",
      "  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,\n",
      "  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can\n",
      "  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might\n",
      "  undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?\n",
      "  One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would\n",
      "  force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one\n",
      "  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with\n",
      "  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most\n",
      "  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have\n",
      "  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in\n",
      "  cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which\n",
      "  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''\n",
      "\n",
      "* What are the US export regulations?\n",
      "\n",
      "  In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control\n",
      "  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export\n",
      "  Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by\n",
      "  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office\n",
      "  of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized\n",
      "  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule\n",
      "  of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent\n",
      "  requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see\n",
      "  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting\n",
      "  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what\n",
      "  people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which\n",
      "  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to\n",
      "  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in\n",
      "  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at\n",
      "  least heard of the ITAR.\n",
      "\n",
      "* What is TEMPEST?\n",
      "\n",
      "  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer\n",
      "  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that\n",
      "  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at\n",
      "  quite a distance and with little effort.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on\n",
      "cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of\n",
      "millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a\n",
      "comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as\n",
      "export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to\n",
      "robust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already\n",
      "reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any\n",
      "public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the\n",
      "Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone\n",
      "equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the\n",
      "National Security Agency.  The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an 80-bit,\n",
      "split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips\n",
      "manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would\n",
      "store users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon\n",
      "presentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be\n",
      "classified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for\n",
      "incorporation into its communications products.\n",
      "\n",
      "     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an\n",
      "inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure\n",
      "product. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.\n",
      "Furthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for\n",
      "the Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers\n",
      "should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the\n",
      "Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF\n",
      "believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The\n",
      "public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is\n",
      "open to independent, expert scrutiny.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Third, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may\n",
      "prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement\n",
      "needs, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is\n",
      "adopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? \n",
      "Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth\n",
      "Amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few\n",
      "of the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to\n",
      "answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance\n",
      "of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy\n",
      "and security.  However, the \"Clipper Chip\" solution ought to be\n",
      "considered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the\n",

      "agents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would\n",
      "have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to\n",
      "the Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be\n",
      "asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration\n",
      "have suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the\n",
      "Federal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,\n",
      "but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.\n",
      "\n",

      "The Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which\n",
      "the government or others could break the code without securing keys from\n",
      "the escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no\n",
      "back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this,\n",

      "  The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted\n",
      "  acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A\n",
      "  by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone\n",
      "  who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "  A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so\n",
      "  that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is\n",
      "  the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art\n",
      "  of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when\n",
      "  you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both\n",
      "  cryptography and cryptanalysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is\n",
      "  called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert\n",
      "  plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert\n",
      "  ciphertext into plaintext.\n",
      "\n",
      "  A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The\n",
      "  algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,\n",
      "  Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different\n",
      "  values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are\n",
      "  called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,\n",
      "  eavesdroppers, or third parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "* What references can I start with to learn cryptology?\n",
      "\n",
      "  For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given\n",
      "  in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,\n",
      "  concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,\n",
      "  these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has\n",
      "  developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and\n",
      "  mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is\n",
      "  encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up\n",
      "  to the mid-60's.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or\n",
      "  Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want\n",
      "  to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common\n",
      "  mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of\n",
      "  many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently\n",
      "  several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The\n",
      "  book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range\n",
      "  of security including encryption algorithms, database security,\n",
      "  access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments\n",
      "  apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].\n",
      "\n",
      "  The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite\n",
      "  technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in\n",
      "  the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of\n",
      "  DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses\n",
      "  of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on\n",
      "  modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management\n",
      "  and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and\n",
      "  networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on\n",
      "  the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.\n",
      "\n",
      "* How does one go about cryptanalysis?\n",
      "\n",
      "  Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of\n",
      "  analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern\n",
      "  finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available\n",
      "  textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series\n",
      "  [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for\n",
      "  the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given\n",
      "  systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the\n",
      "  cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still\n",
      "  classified.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,\n",
      "  or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare\n",
      "  of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the\n",
      "  most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "* What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?\n",
      "\n",
      "  In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can\n",
      "  find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding\n",
      "  ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the\n",
      "  plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or\n",
      "  decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.\n",
      "  Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this\n",
      "  brute-force search is impractical.\n",
      "    \n",
      "  Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered\n",
      "  practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years\n",
      "  now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with\n",
      "  this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the\n",
      "  mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic\n",
      "  decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel\n",
      "  machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.\n",
      "  Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].\n",
      "\n",
      "  One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a\n",
      "  brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "* What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?\n",
      "\n",
      "  The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key\n",
      "  rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.\n",
      "\n",
      "  A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The\n",
      "  unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of\n",
      "  ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and\n",
      "  if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount\n",
      "  of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is\n",
      "  probably strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "  A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears\n",
      "  random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).\n",
      "    \n",
      "  A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A\n",
      "  system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "  If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily\n",
      "  strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.\n",
      "  However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is\n",
      "  strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then\n",
      "  he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring\n",
      "  integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.\n",
      "\n",
      "* If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it\n",
      "  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?\n",
      "\n",
      "  Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical\n",
      "  cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your\n",
      "  ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might\n",
      "  assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is\n",
      "  correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the\n",
      "  rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same\n",
      "  plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus\n",
      "  he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he\n",
      "  doesn't have a chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,\n",
      "  for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even\n",
      "  chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into\n",
      "  the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See\n",

      "  In a classic cryptosystem, we have encryption functions E_K and\n",
      "  decryption functions D_K such that D_K(E_K(P)) = P for any plaintext\n",
      "  P. In a public-key cryptosystem, E_K can be easily computed from some\n",
      "  ``public key'' X which in turn is computed from K. X is published, so\n",
      "  that anyone can encrypt messages. If D_K cannot be easily computed\n",
      "  from X, then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages.\n",
      "  That's the essence of public-key cryptography, published by Diffie\n",
      "  and Hellman in 1976.\n",
      "\n",
      "  In a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to\n",
      "  send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than\n",
      "  them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish X,\n",
      "  and you don't have to worry about spies.\n",
      "\n",
      "  This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. There is an\n",
      "  extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,\n",
      "  applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the\n",
      "  mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "* What's RSA?\n",
      "\n",
      "  RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest, Shamir, and\n",
      "  Adleman.  For full details, there is a FAQ available by ftp at\n",
      "  RSA.COM. Here's a small example.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples\n",
      "  (p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,\n",
      "  and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We\n",
      "  define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq, D_K(C) = C^d mod pq.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as\n",
      "  anyone knows, there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair\n",
      "  (pq,e). So whoever generates K can publish (pq,e). Anyone can send a\n",
      "  secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Is RSA secure?\n",
      "\n",
      "  Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q.\n",
      "  See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization\n",
      "  algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to\n",
      "  prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that\n",
      "  matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by\n",
      "  ``RSA is/isn't strong''; but, as Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr., says,\n",
      "  ``Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to\n",
      "  prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist, and\n",
      "  theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative\n",
      "  results.''\n",
      "\n",
      "* How fast can people factor numbers?\n",
      "\n",
      "  It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra\n",
      "  and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes, using about three\n",
      "  weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine;\n",
      "  each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The\n",
      "  algorithm there is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a\n",
      "  bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers\n",
      "  n, but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1/3} n log^{2/3} log n)) in\n",
      "  any case.\n",
      "\n",
      "  An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple\n",
      "  polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(O(log^{1/2} n\n",
      "  log^{1/2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,\n",
      "  but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100\n",
      "  and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few\n",
      "  years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are\n",
      "  developed, then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from\n",
      "  factorization, but one can't predict the future. (Before the number\n",
      "  field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic\n",
      "  sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.)\n",
      "\n",
      "* What about other public-key cryptosystems?\n",
      "\n",
      "  We've talked about RSA because it's well known and easy to describe.\n",
      "  But there are lots of other public-key systems around, many of which\n",
      "  are faster than RSA or depend on problems more widely believed to be\n",
      "  difficult. This has been just a brief introduction; if you really want\n",

      "\n",
      "  A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and\n",
      "  produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally\n",
      "  impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't\n",
      "  determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not\n",
      "  even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also\n",
      "  computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the\n",
      "  same hash.\n",
      "\n",
      "  A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an\n",
      "  encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash\n",
      "  function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are\n",
      "  relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user\n",
      "  is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,\n",
      "  and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the\n",
      "  signature can do the same thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.\n",
      "\n",
      "* What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?\n",
      "\n",
      "  There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a\n",
      "  very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which\n",
      "  isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it\n",
      "  a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption\n",
      "  functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have\n",
      "  hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1\n",
      "  if and only if X = H(M).\n",
      "\n",
      "  A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private\n",
      "  decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the\n",
      "  previous question, have public hashing and public verification.\n",
      "  Digital signature functions have private hashing and public\n",
      "  verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,\n",
      "  but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to\n",
      "  be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real\n",
      "  difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key\n",
      "  isn't published, so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend\n",
      "  rather than ``for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing\n",
      "  ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No.\n",

      "\n",
      "  In email messages, additional information on the path that a message\n",

      "  type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET\n",
      "  protocol to a lesser extent.  Forging these fields requires\n",

      "  The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication,\n",
      "  privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of\n",
      "  computer networks. For example, the convenience of communication\n",
      "  afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for\n",
      "  identification.  But there are many potential abuses of identity\n",
      "  possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive\n",
      "  computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can\n",
      "  potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication',\n",
      "  and one classic example of the problems associated with it is\n",
      "  H.G.Well's ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled\n",
      "  segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was\n",
      "  in progress.  Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and\n",
      "  forged identities makes them more insidious.  People and their\n",
      "  reputations can be assaulted by forgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "  However, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of\n",
      "  its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is\n",
      "  harmful.  A professor might carefully explain a topic until he\n",
      "  finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular\n",
      "  occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally\n",
      "  shun him.  Some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many\n",
      "  prejudices are useful!  A scientist might argue he can better\n",
      "  evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more\n",
      "  about the authors.  Likewise, he may be more likely to reject it\n",
      "  based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  On the other side of the\n",
      "  connection,  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in\n",
      "  exerting pressure for acceptance.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating\n",
      "  `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'. \n",
      "  Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques\n",

      "  Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances\n",

      "LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:\n",
      " \n",
      "A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used\n",
      "for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.\n",
      "The \"floor\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions\n",
      "is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\n",
      "creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and\n",
      "machine-lets.\n",
      " \n",
      " The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:\n",
      " 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\n",
      " 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\n",
      " 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.\n",
      " \n",
      " Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on\n",
      " it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture\n",
      " content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent\n",
      " to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.\n",
      " \n",
      "The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains\n",
      "with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control\n",
      "electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will\n",
      "receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their\n",
      "data link to LTM1.\n",
      " \n",
      "Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a\n",
      "servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the\n",
      "SSTO\n",
      "to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\n",
      "landscape and land.\n",
      " \n",
      "Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped\n",
      "bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators\n",
      "worldwide\n",
      "to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and\n",
      "takeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on\n",
      "commercially\n",
      "available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the\n",
      "interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced\n",
      "ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.\n",
      " \n",

      "a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be\n",
      "provided in under 80 man hours.\n",
      " \n",
      "PLAN OF ACTION:\n",
      " \n",
      "The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by\n",
      "providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network.\n",
      "Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\n",
      "of the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be\n",
      "modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \"rail stock\"\n",
      "for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical\n",
      "communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.\n",
      "An initial \"ground breaking\" with miniature shovels will be performed for\n",
      "a live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial\n",
      "models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for\n",
      "historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely\n",
      "serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional\n",
      "building, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and\n",
      "the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution\n",
      "world-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will be\n",

      " \n",
      "A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then\n",
      "be\n",
      "announced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to\n",
      "find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of\n",
      "the lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that\n",
      "time\n",
      "the results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will\n",
      "then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return\n",
      "to\n",
      "their campus.\n",
      " \n",
      "A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via\n",
      "conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment\n",
      "addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.\n",
      "Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\n",
      "opportunity for the television community. Especially since the \"action\"\n",
      "will\n",
      "be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be\n",
      "invited to issue \"challenges\" to engineering and human factors students at\n",
      "universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform\n",
      "lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be\n",
      "simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.\n",
      " \n",
      "The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,\n",
      "experimentation\n",
      "and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a\n",
      "long\n",
      "term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic\n",
      "example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited\n",

      ">    as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract\n",
      ">    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever\n",

      ">of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after\n",
      ">the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff,\n",
      ">just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?\n",
      "> \n",
      ">I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping\n",
      ">on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because\n",
      ">it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill\n",
      ">non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this\n",

      ">at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the\n",
      ">floor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire\n",
      ">in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.\n",
      "> \n",
      ">And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that\n",
      ">smoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains\n",
      ">nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually\n",

      ">This is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic.\n",
      ">The guy who represented the company in the press conference defended\n",
      ">himself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every day\n",
      ">for a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal-\n",

      "  - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)\n",

      "  - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the\n",
      "    seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.\n",
      "  - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.\n",
      "  - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on\n",
      "    Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.\n",
      "  - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.\n",
      "    Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases\n",
      "    network traffic.\n",
      "  - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this\n",
      "    is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'\n",
      "    hierarchy is preferred.\n",
      "  - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.\n",
      "    references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for\n",
      "    readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any\n",
      "    inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even\n",
      "    future ones under the same handle.\n",
      "  - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your\n",
      "    identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by\n",
      "    sending anonymized mail to yourself.\n",
      "  - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them. \n",

      "  and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack\n",

      "  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system\n",
      "  from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the\n",

      "  and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by\n",
      "  multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended\n",

      "* In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?\n",
      "\n",
      "  A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a\n",
      "  decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of\n",
      "  functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of\n",
      "  ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the\n",
      "  decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that\n",
      "  D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption\n",
      "  of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key\n",
      "  (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext\n",
      "  into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to\n",
      "  encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.\n",
      "\n",
      "* What is an attack?\n",
      "\n",
      "  In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method\n",
      "  of starting with some information about plaintexts and their\n",
      "  corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out\n",
      "  more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state\n",
      "  mathematically what this means. Here we go.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,\n",
      "  and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "  An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an\n",
      "  algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that\n",
      "  there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have\n",
      "  f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this\n",
      "  probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).\n",
      "\n",
      "  The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at\n",
      "  least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and\n",
      "  g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible\n",
      "  ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other\n",
      "  words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions\n",
      "  E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).\n",
      "\n",
      "  An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if\n",
      "  n = 2, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "* What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?\n",
      "\n",
      "  In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.\n",
      "  Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this\n",
      "  property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem\n",
      "  is strong!''\n",
      "\n",
      "  In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely\n",
      "  formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is\n",
      "  strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against\n",
      "  all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as\n",
      "  defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this\n",
      "  statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist\n",
      "  any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement\n",
      "  to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that\n",
      "  the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical\n",
      "  definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions\n",
      "  we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can\n",
      "  figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used\n",
      "  properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst\n",
      "  can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to\n",
      "  construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,\n",
      "  and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.\n",
      "  \n",
      "* Why is the one-time pad secure?\n",
      "\n",
      "  By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the\n",
      "  plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)\n",
      "  of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive\n",
      "  or) of K and P.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial\n",
      "  single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform\n",
      "  distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform\n",
      "  distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack,\n",
      "  i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,\n",
      "  with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and\n",
      "  g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the distribution of\n",
      "  K is uniform and independent of P, the distribution of K + P must also\n",
      "  be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is\n",
      "  uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p\n",
      "  that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus\n",
      "  a fortiori A is trivial.)\n",
      "\n",
      "  On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used\n",
      "  for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial\n",
      "  multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be\n",
      "  thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad'';\n",
      "  this explains the name ``one-time pad.''\n",
      "\n",
      "* What's a ciphertext-only attack?\n",
      "\n",
      "  In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is\n",
      "  constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about\n",
      "  n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some\n",
      "  information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial\n",
      "  if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given\n",
      "  G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.\n",
      "\n",
      "  For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can\n",
      "  easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply\n",
      "  guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use\n",
      "  the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no\n",
      "  matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which\n",
      "  produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C.\n",
      "  If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is\n",
      "  a nontrivial attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "* What's a known-plaintext attack?\n",
      "\n",
      "  The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1,\n",
      "  G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2.\n",
      "  In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption\n",
      "  P_1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the\n",
      "  other decryption P_2.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature\n",
      "  as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the\n",
      "  cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him\n",
      "  decrypt further messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "* What's a chosen-plaintext attack?\n",
      "\n",
      "  A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical\n",
      "  series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the\n",
      "  cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into\n",
      "  our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a\n",
      "  chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and\n",
      "  look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured\n",
      "  out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of\n",
      "  attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''\n",
      "\n",
      "  A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption\n",
      "  attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a\n",
      "  way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.\n",
      "\n",
      "  There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks:\n",
      "  for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as\n",
      "  T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew\n",
      "  for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash\n",
      "  function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or.\n",
      "\n",
      "* In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?\n",
      "\n",
      "  Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some\n",
      "  plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're\n",
      "  also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find\n",
      "  K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).\n",
      "\n",
      "  If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed\n",
      "  on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results\n",
      "  only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial\n",
      "  attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many\n",
      "  possible keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?\n",
      "\n",
      "  Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys\n",
      "  randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to\n",
      "  for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which\n",
      "  are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English\n",

      "The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\n",
      "The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\n",
      "(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\n",
      "coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\n",
      "(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\n",
      "algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\n",
      "difference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\n",
      "algorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\n",
      "use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\n",
      "dominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\n",
      "the dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\n",
      "\n",
      "Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\n",
      "+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\n",
      "over this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\n",
      "is thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\n",
      "expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\n",
      "somewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\n",
      "by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\n",
      "constant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\n",
      "lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\n",
      "to hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\n",
