# Blog-App
Teamed up with Jinit Sanghvi for a college project.
A simple blog application made using Django.

- You can create a user and delete existing users.
- Users can post blogs which are time-stamped with the date posted.
- The blog can be edited and deleted.
- There is a admin who has access over all the users and blogs

- Each blog will pass through our NLP model, which will extract main topics
  covered in the blog.
- These will then be tagged into our blog, so they are nicely grouped into
  meaningful topics searchable using tags.
